Objective - The assignment is meant for you to apply learnings of the module on Hive on a real-life dataset. One of the major objectives of this assignment is gaining familiarity with how an analysis works in Hive and how you can gain insights from large datasets.
 
Problem Statement - New York City is a thriving metropolis and just like most other cities of similar size, one of the biggest problems its residents face is parking. The classic combination of a huge number of cars and a cramped geography is the exact recipe that leads to a large number of parking tickets.
 
In an attempt to scientifically analyse this phenomenon, the NYC Police Department regularly collects data related to parking tickets. This data is made available by NYC Open Data portal. We will try and perform some analysis on this data.

To load data into partition and bucket table we need to set few properties to enable bucketing and 
Dynamic partition

hive>set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
hive>set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict; 
hive>set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
Hive>  insert into parking_violations_issued_2017 partition(Violation_County) select

No_Standing_or_Stopping_Violation,Hydrant_Violation,Double_Parking_Violation,Violation_County from parking_violations_issued where 
year(Issue_Date) = '2017';


The analysis can be divided into two parts:
 Part-I: Examine the data
1.) Find the total number of tickets for the year.
Hive>  select count(distinct summons_number) No_Tickets  ,year(issue_date) as year from parking_violations_issued_2017 group by year(issue_date);

Total number of tickets for the year 2017 are 539901
2.) Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
Hive>  select count(distinct Registration_State) as Reg_state_count from parking_violations_issued_2017;

Hive>  select distinct(Registration_State) as Reg_state from parking_violations_issued_2017;


Hive>  SELECT Registration_State,Count(1) as Number_of_Records from parking_violations_issued_2017  group by Registration_State order by Number_of_Records;

3.) Some parking tickets don’t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
Hive> select count(distinct summons_number) as No_Tickets_without_address from parking_violations_issued where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;


Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1.) How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
Hive> select count(Violation_Code) as frequency_of_violation,Violation_Code from parking_violations_issued_2017 group by Violation_Code order by frequency_of_violation desc limit 5;

2.) How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
Hive> select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket  from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5; --done


Hive> select Vehicle_make,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 group by Vehicle_make order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5; --done


3.) A precinct is a police station that has a certain zone of the city under its command. Find the (5 highest) frequencies of:
      a.) Violating Precincts (this is the precinct of the zone where the violation occurred)

hive> select Violation_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from challenge.parking_violations_issued group by  Violation_Precinct order by IssuedTicket desc limit 6;--correct

      b.) Issuer Precincts (this is the precinct that issued the ticket)
Hive> select Issuer_Precinct,count(*) as IssuedTicket from challenge.parking_violations_issued group by Issuer_Precinct order by IssuedTicket desc limit 6;--correct 

4.) Find the violation code frequency across 3 precincts which have issued the most number of tickets - do these precinct zones have an exceptionally high frequency of certain violation codes?
select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017  group by Issuer_Precinct, Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;


We will not be considering 0. Therefore 18,19,14 are the three issuer precincts which have the maximum number of violations. Lets analyze the Issuer Precincts one by one.
--Issuer Precinct 18
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 where Issuer_Precinct=18 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;

--Issuer Precinct 19
select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 where Issuer_Precinct=19 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;


--Issuer Precinct 14
Hive> select Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 where Issuer_Precinct=14 group by Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 7;
--Common codes accross precincts
Hive>  select Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code, count(*) as TicketsIssued from challenge.parking_violations_issued_2017 where Issuer_Precinct in (18,19,14) 
group by Issuer_Precinct,Violation_Code order by TicketsIssued desc limit 10;


5.) Find out the properties of parking violations across different times of the day: The Violation Time field is specified in a strange format. Find a way to make this into a time attribute that you can use to divide into groups.
Hive> select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(regexp_extract(violation_time,'(.*)[A-Z]',1),'HHmm'),"HH:mm") as date_data from parking_violations_issued limit 2;--> converted to time format 01:43
Hive> select from_unixtime(unix_timestamp(concat(violation_time,'M'), 'HHmmaaa'),"HH:mmaaa") as date_data from parking_violations_issued limit 2;-->  working 01:43AM


6.) Divide 24 hours into 6 equal discrete bins of time. The intervals you choose are at your discretion. For each of these groups, find the 3 most commonly occurring violations

and substring(Violation_Time,1,2) in ('00','01','02','03','04','05','06','07', '08','09','10','11','12'));

7.) Now, try another direction. For the 3 most commonly occurring violation codes, find the most common times of day (in terms of the bins from the previous part)
Hive>  select Violation_Time_bin, count(*) TicketsIssued from vw_parking_violations_2017_partitioned_bins where Violation_Code in (21, 37, 38,36) 
group by Violation_Time_bin order by TicketsIssued desc limit 3;

8.) Let’s try and find some seasonality in this data
      a.) First, divide the year into some number of seasons, and find frequencies of tickets for each season. (Hint: A quick Google search reveals the following seasons in NYC: Spring(March, April, March); Summer(June, July, August); Fall(September, October, November); Winter(December, January, February))

Season    Month interval
spring    March, April, May
summer    June, July, August
autumn    September, October, November
winter    December, January, February

when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 03 and 05 then 'spring' 
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 06 and 08 then 'summer' 
when MONTH(Issue_Date) between 09 and 11 then 'autumn' 
when MONTH(Issue_Date) in (1,2,12) then 'winter'

I have used partionsed and Bucketing on Table - parking_violations_issued_2017 , and partions on views - vw_parking_violations_2017_partitioned_bins partitioned, vw_tickets_issued_2017_bins
That improves query performance.

Note: Please ensure you make necessary optimizations to your queries like selecting the appropriate table format, using partitioned/bucketed tables. Marks will be awarded for keeping the performance also in mind.
