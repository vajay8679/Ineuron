# LibraryApp
This is a Application, which can perform CRUD operations on Books of a library. <br>
This repository contains the code of the article on this url : https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-crud-example/<br>
All my blogs on Django Framework can be found on dataflair's django series, and more repositories for the articles can be found on my Gtihub profile.
